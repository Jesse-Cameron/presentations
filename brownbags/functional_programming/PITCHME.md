#### What even is Functional Programming?

Look, I don't consider myself an expert. What I do know is:


I think that the meme is that the won't really understand functional programming until you do Haskell.

@ul
- monads
- functors
- applicatives
@ulend

Nah, miss me with that BS.
Let's get down to what makes the _real_ functional stuff work.

#### what do we want to know?

Chances are: a lot of us are using a lot of functional programming concepts in our apps/apis/sdks already.

@ul
- map/filter/reduce
- Object Spread
@ulend

But, are there ways that we can use it to unlock these skills:

@ul
- readability
- testability
- together we get: confidence
@ulend

Note:

As a software engineer, having confidence in your software is paramount.

#### What are side effect?

When people talk about functional programming, you'll hear constantly:
_No Side Effects_

But what the heck even is that? 
Is it like a medicine?

Note:

Insert casual dig a OO programming.
