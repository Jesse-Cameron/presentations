#### What even is Functional Programming?

- it's been around since like the _50's..._
- Languages like Haskell, Clojure, Erlang
- it's _really_ hot right now because of JS
    - But is JS even a functional language?

@ul

- applicatives
@ulend

**Nah,** miss me with that **BS**.
Let's get down to what makes the _real_ functional stuff work.

#### what do we want to know?

Chances are: a lot of us are using a lot of functional programming concepts in our apps/apis/sdks already.

@ul
- map/filter/reduce
- Object Spread
@ulend

But, are there ways that we can use it to unlock these skills:

@ul
- readability
- testability
- together we get: confidence
@ulend

Note:

As a software engineer, having confidence in your software is paramount.

#### What are side effect?

When people talk about functional programming, you'll hear constantly:
_No Side Effects_

But what the heck even is that? 
Is it like a medicine?

Note:

Insert casual dig a OO programming.
