#### what do we want to know?

Chances are: a lot of us are using a lot of functional programming concepts in our apps/apis/sdks already.

- map
- filter

But, are there ways that we can use it to unlock these skills:

- readability
- testability
- together we get: confidence

Note:

As a software engineer, having confidence in your software is paramount.
