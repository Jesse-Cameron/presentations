# @size[2em]WAYS PHOTOGRAPHY MADE ME A BETTER DEVELOPER

#### This presentation:

@ul
 - I've been a `developer` and a `photographer` for roughly 5 years each.
 - There have been a couple of photographs that have taught me lessons beyond _just_ photography. 
 - None of these lessons are ground breaking. But, another perspective never hurts.
