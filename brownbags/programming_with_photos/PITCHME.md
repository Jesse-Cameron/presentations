# @size[2em]3 Lessons Learnt from Taking Photos

---

#### This presentation:

@ul
 - I've been a developer and a photographer for roughly 5 years each.
 - There have been a couple of photographs that have taught me lessons beyond _just_ photographer. 
 - None of these lessons are ground breaking. But, another perspective never hurts.
