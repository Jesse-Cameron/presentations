# WAYS PHOTOGRAPHY MADE ME A BETTER DEVELOPER

---

#### `whoami`

@ul
- I've been a `developer` and a `photographer` for roughly 5 years (each).
- Currently I'm:
    - Junior Developer at Localz ðŸ’¼
    - Volunteer Developer for Robogals ðŸ¤–
    - Proud plant dad ðŸŒ±
@ulend




#### What is heck is this talk about?!:

@ul
- There are a couple photographs I've taken which have taught me lessons beyond _just_ photography.
- None of these lessons are amazingly ground breaking. But, another perspective never hurts.

### Photograph #1: Try not to get caught in the headlights.

It's so easy to get lost in the image that you are editing.

When you first start developing code it's easy to over optimise your code. <br/>
You can get lost in code your working on without considering the larger context <br/>

---

Take a moment. Breath. Walk away from what you are doing.
Come back to it with a fresh perspective.

### Photo #2: You and your audience likely won't agree on what's great.

Here are two of my images
One of them definitely has a special place in my heart. Which I thought would resonate with my audience. The other not so much.

The same can happen with your product. <br/>
You can put all of this time and work into a feature that you think is going to blow the market away. ðŸ”¥ <br/>
But you can get to d-day and realise that your users are using your product in a totally unexpected or unintentional way. <br/>

Always pay attention to your user, yo!

### Photo #3: Less surface area === less chance to f*ck something up.
