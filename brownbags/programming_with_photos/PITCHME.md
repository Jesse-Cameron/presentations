# WAYS PHOTOGRAPHY MADE ME A BETTER DEVELOPER

## `whoami`

@ul

### What in heck is this talk about?!

@ul
- There are a couple photographs I've taken which have taught me lessons beyond _just_ photography.
- None of these lessons are amazingly ground breaking. But, another perspective never hurts.

## Photograph #1:
## Try not to get caught in the headlights.

---
_Context_: <br/>
If you take photos for long enough with intent. There will occasionally be photos that push your skill level up a notch.

This is one of them.

Note:

- I was in a darkroom
- Easy to focus on one aspect of an image when you are 
- Once you take your print out of the darkroom you'll see it in a different light
- Later reflected that it wasn't the image that I envisioned.

It's so easy to get lost in the image that you are editing.

+++

Similarly, when developing Software it's easy to get lost in the task you're working on.

+++

Which can result in:

@ul
- Over optimisation.
- Early optimisation.
- Building features that are unnecessary.
@ulend

---

You can get lost in code your working on without considering the larger context.

---

Take a moment. <br/>
Breath. <br/>
Walk away from what you are doing. <br/>
Come back to it with a fresh perspective. <br/>

---

## Photo #2:
## You and your audience likely won't agree on what's great.

---

I'm going to show you two images.
One of them definitely has a special place in my heart. Which I thought would resonate with my audience. The other not so much.

The same can happen with your product. <br/>
You can put all of this time and work into a feature that you think is going to blow the market away. ðŸ”¥ <br/>
But you can get to d-day and realise that your users are using your product in a totally unexpected or unintentional way. <br/>

Always pay attention to your user, yo!

---

## Photo #3:
## Less surface area === less chance to f*ck something up.

Note:

- There are very few rules of soft engineering that I actually 'abide by'. 
- This is one of them.
- Time and time again. Less code means less surface area for bugs means less bugs.

---

Perfection is kinda BS. <br/>
It's a highly _unlikely_ end state.

Most of the time, the best you are going to get is solving for a specific situation. <br/>
In photography, this might be trying to elicit a specific _feeling_ from your viewer. <br/>
In development, you might be trying to solve a consumers pain. <br/>

---

Focus on the MVP and solve for that. <br/>
Learn to deliver and improve on your results <br/>

## Conclusion

@ul
- Don't get caught in the headlines.
    - Take a moment.
    - Breathe.
    -  Come back with a clear mind.
- Pay attention to your users.
- Focus on delivering MVP _then_ improving
- Ultimately, never forget that this is a journey.
    - You aren't going to become a genius overnight
    - Let me stress this, _you aren't going to become a genius overnight_
