### What in heck is this talk about?!

@ul
- There are a couple photographs I've taken which have taught me lessons beyond _just_ photography.
- None of these lessons are amazingly ground breaking. But, another perspective never hurts.

## Photograph #1:
## Try not to get caught in the headlights.

_Context_
If you take photos for long enough with intent. There will occasionally be photos that push your skill level up a notch.

IMAGE HERE
This is one of them.

Note:

- I was in a darkroom
- Easy to focus on one aspect of an image when you are 
- Once you take your print out of the darkroom you'll see it in a different light
- Later reflected that it wasn't the image that I envisioned.

It's so easy to get lost in the image that you are editing.

Similarly, when developing Software it's easy to get lost in the task you're working on.

Which can result in:

@ul
- Over optimisation.
- Pre-mature optimisation
@ulend

You can get lost in code your working on without considering the larger context <br/>

---

Take a moment. <br/>
Breath. Walk away from what you are doing. <br/>
Come back to it with a fresh perspective. <br/>

## Photo #2:
## You and your audience likely won't agree on what's great.

---

Here are two of my images
One of them definitely has a special place in my heart. Which I thought would resonate with my audience. The other not so much.

The same can happen with your product. <br/>
You can put all of this time and work into a feature that you think is going to blow the market away. ðŸ”¥ <br/>
But you can get to d-day and realise that your users are using your product in a totally unexpected or unintentional way. <br/>

Always pay attention to your user, yo!

## Photo #3: Less surface area === less chance to f*ck something up.
